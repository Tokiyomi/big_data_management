## In-memory
A in-memory database (IMDB, also known as a main memory database or MMDB) is a type of database management system which storage data on the main memory. One of the big differences between a database management system that uses a disk storage mechanism and a in-memory database, is that a in-memory database is considerable faster when talking about response time due to disk access is slower than memory access. An important disadvantage of IMDBs is that it exists a great risk to lose data upon a process or server failure because all data is stored and managed in the main memory. However, a IMDB is also capable to save data on a disk by storing each operation in a log or by taking snapshots.

### How does it works?
According to information provided by Margaret Rouse in her blog post [ in-memory database](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/in-memory-database): "Source data is loaded into system memory in a compressed, non-relational format".  This means that there is no need to decompress, decrypt or decode data, which allows direct navigation.

The quick response of a in-memory database is possible because is not necessary to translate and cache data, which means that data is used in the same form as the in-memory database management system.

According to OmniSci: "An in-memory database system can also act as an read-only analytic database that stores historical data on metrics for business intelligence (BI) applications. This eliminates data indexing, which can reduce IT costs".

### Advantages and disadvantages of In-memory databases

| Advantages                                                                           | Disadvantages                        |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| There is no need to deal with secondary storage since it manages all data in the RAM | The type of memory used is not persistent                      |
| Optimized for high-performance                                                       | The volume of data that can be stored tends to be much smaller |
| Quicker data analysis                                                                | The data stored is only temporary                              |
| Better transfer speed of unstructured data                                           | It is not the best option in terms of security                   


### Common use cases

### Traditional database vs In-memory database

| Traditional database                                                                                 | In-memory database                     |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Retrieves data from disk drives                                                                      | Keeps all data in the main memory                                                                                                     |
| Data can be more easily restored from the disks                                                      | Data is lost when there is a loss of power                             |
| When one part refers to another part, a different block must be read from the disk                   | Different parts of the database can be managed through direct pointers |
| Store redundant data as the system creates a copy of it for each component added to the system | Allow real-time analysis and reporting of data                         |

### How do I know my business needs a in-memory database?

According to Ionos, if you consider the following statements are true, then you need a IMDB:
- You need fast and frequent access to your data.
- Your existing database management systems or servers are overloaded,
- Data persistence is not your highest priority.
- Loss of data (or at least the possibility of this) is workable for you.

### Popular in-memory databases
- Redis
- Aerospike
- TimesTen
- SAP HANA

## Graph

Graph databases are purpose-built to store and navigate relationships. Relationships are first-class citizens in graph databases, and most of the value of graph databases is derived from these relationships. Graph databases use nodes to store data entities, and edges to store relationships between entities.
### Description
To better grasp the concept of graph databases, it’s important to understand the following terms:

| Terms             | Description    |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Node |A node is a representation of an individual entity tracked by a graph database. For example, in a graph database of music recording artists, a node might represent a single performer or band.      
| Property | A property is relevant information related to individual nodes. Building on our recording artist example, some properties might be “vocalist,” “jazz,” or “platinum-selling artist,” depending on what information is relevant to the database.
| Edge |A property is relevant information related to individual nodes. Building on our recording artist example, some properties might be “vocalist,” “jazz,” or “platinum-selling artist,” depending on what information is relevant to the database.    
| Directed Graph| In a directed graph, edges can have different meanings based on which direction the relationship originates from. In this case, edges are “one-way” relationships. For example, a directed graph database might specify a relationship from Sammy to the Seaweeds showing that Sammy produced an album for the group but might not show an equivalent relationship from The Seaweeds to Sammy.
| Undirected Graph | In an undirected graph, the edges between nodes exist just to show a connection between them. In this case, edges can be thought of as “two-way” relationships — there’s no implied difference between how one node relates to the other.


### Example
Twitter is a perfect example of a graph database connecting 330 million monthly active users.

In the illustration below, we have a small slice of Twitter users represented in a graph database. Each node (labeled User) belongs to a single person and is connected with relationships describing how each user is connected. As we see below, Peter and Emil follow each other, as do Emil and Johan, but although Johan follows Peter, Peter hasn’t (yet) reciprocated.

### Applications
- **Fraud detection:** Graph databases are capable of sophisticated fraud prevention. With graph databases, you can use relationships to process financial and purchase transactions in near-real time. With fast graph queries, you are able to detect that, for example, a potential purchaser is using the same email address and credit card as included in a known fraud case.  **Recommendation engines:**Graph databases can also help you easily detect relationship patterns such as multiple people associated with a personal email address, or multiple people sharing the same IP address but residing in different physical addresses.
- **Recommendation engines:** Graph databases are a good choice for recommendation applications. With graph databases, you can store in a graph relationships between information categories such as customer interests, friends, and purchase history. You can use a highly available graph database to make product recommendations to a user based on which products are purchased by others who follow the same sport and have similar purchase history. Or, you can identify people who have a friend in common but don’t yet know each other, and then make a friendship recommendation.
            
### Capabilities                       
- Models graphs consisting of nodes and edges with properties (meta-data) describing them.
- Implement very fast graph traversal operations.
- Also, support indexing of metadata to enable graph traversal combined with search queries.

### Limitations
- Difficult to scale for large data sets for generic graphs.
- [Giraph](http://giraph.apache.org/) uses the [Bulk Synchronous Parallel model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulk_synchronous_parallel) to overcome some of the scalability limitations.

### Popular open-source graph databases

| Database | Description |
|--|--|
| [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) | An [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID)-compliant DBMS with native graph storage and processing. As of this writing, Neo4j is [the most popular graph database in the world](https://db-engines.com/en/ranking/graph+dbms). |
| [ArangoDB](https://www.arangodb.com/) | Not exclusively a graph database, ArangoDB is a multi-model database that unites the graph, document, and key-value data models in one DBMS. It features AQL (a native SQL-like query language), full-text search, and a ranking engine.  | 
| [OrientDB](https://orientdb.com/) | Another multi-model database, OrientDB supports the graph, document, key-value, and object models. It supports SQL queries and ACID transactions.  |

## Document-oriented

*Document-oriented* databases store their data in the form of *documents*. But what are *documents*? According to Mark Drake (2019): 

> “_Document-oriented databases_, or _document stores_, are NoSQL databases that store data in the form of documents. Document stores are a type of [key-value store](https://web.archive.org/web/20190813163612/https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/a-comparison-of-nosql-database-management-systems-and-models#key-value-databases): each document has a unique identifier — its key — and the document itself serves as the value."

It’s something in the form:

[document form example link](https://miro.medium.com/max/1532/1*k663iOSw0Kj_4ctQjwrLcQ.png)

Or in the form:
![XML_example](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tok_Ling/publication/220787904/figure/fig1/AS:669041488306196@1536523329820/Sample-bibliography-XML-document.png)

### Document features
-   A document is a roughly application of an *object* in programming and all its features - such as many optional fields.

-   They aren’t required to follow a standard schema

-   As you can see, documents encapsulate data in some standard forms of encoding such as `JSON`, `BSON`, `XML` and `YAML` to mention a few.

-   You can nest documents into other documents.

### Addresing documents
Documents are addressed in the database via a *unique key* that represents that document, i.e. an unique  `ID` field for each document, typically a `string`, a `URI`, or a `path`.

### Organization
We can organize our documents in different ways or implementations, for example:

-   Collections: a group of documents that are stored in a collection is similar to a group of tables inside a relational database.
    
-   Tags and non-visible metadata: additional data outside the document content, for example comments.
    
-   Directory hierarchies: documents having a tree structure, based on a path or URI

### API – Query language
*Document-oriented*  often come with an *API* or *Query language* that allows users to retrieve documents based on the metadata they contain.

### Applications
-   Applications that need to manage a large variety of objects that differ in structure
    
-   Large product catalogs in e-commerce, customer profiles, content management applications

### Limitations
-   No standard query syntax
    
-   Query performance not linearly  scalable
    
-   Join queries across collections not efficient

### Popular open-source document-oriented databases

| Database | Description |
|--|--|
| [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) | A general purpose, distirbuted document store, MongoDB is [the world's most widely used document-oriented database](https://db-engines.com/en/ranking/document+store). |
| [Couchbase](https://www.couchbase.com/) | Originally known as Membase, a JSON-based, Memcached-compatible document-based store. A multi-model database, Couchbase can also function as a key-value store.  | 
| [Apache CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/) | A project of the Apache Software Foundation, CouchDB stores data as JSON documents and uses JavaScript as its query language.  |
